* VPN
All of this has to be sudo, so I think it's worthwhile to start a sudo-copier.py
** To start, have a file ready called auth.txt that contains username and password.
** wget https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/openvpn/openvpn.zip , unzip
** find and replace in all of those auth-user-pass with auth-user-pass auth.txt
** Change the owner of everything to root:network
** Move it all to /etc/openvpn/client, creating if necessary
** Maybe eventually make a thing that connects on wifi access.
